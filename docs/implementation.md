# Steps to Implement

## Core Implementation
1. ~~Implement the Grid~~
2. ~~Implement the Ant adding functionality~~
3. ~~Implement Ant movement (use laws from README.md)~~

## Enhancements (Optional):
- Allow user to add the ant manually by clicking on the grid (+ picking which direction the ant is facing)
- Add multiple ants with different starting positions and facing directions
- ~~Add `speed up` and `slow down` functionality~~
- ~~Add `ESC` to go out of simulation~~
- ~~Add `SPACE` to pause/resume simulation~~
- ~~Add `R` to reset simulation~~
